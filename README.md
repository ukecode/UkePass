1. In Chrome, open the Extensions page, in either of two ways: you can access it by
using the Window menu or the Chrome customization menu (the icon at the upper
right of the Chrome window) or, in the address bar, you can type chrome://exten

Chrome Apps as well as Extensions.)
2. Ensure that the “Developer mode” checkbox is checked.
3. Click the “Load unpacked extension” button and then select the Chrome App’s folder.
